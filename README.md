# Introduction 
A simple pipeline for transforming audio data to aid in testing. 

# Getting Started

1.	Installation process
The pipeline depends on a recent pytorch implementation
`pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`

If this environment isn't sufficient, a requirements.txt file is provided. The resulting environment will be much larger, though.

# Build and Test
`python audio_transformations.py`
